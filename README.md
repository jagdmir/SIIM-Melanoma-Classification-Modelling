# SIIM-Melanoma-Classification - This is an ongoing Kaggle Competition

Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.

In this competition,we need to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, we have used images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. Using patient-level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools, which could better support clinical dermatologists.

I have created a VGG16 model(Transfer Learning) for image classification

I have used Image Augmentation to generate more images for training purpose

I have used to develp the VGG16 model

I have achieved 87% of AUC on the test data with the model created.
